Please generate markdown-formatted advertising content based on the selected outputs. Include ONLY the following sections, clearly labeled and in this exact order if selected:

1. **KV Headline**
2. **OOH Headlines** (provide 5 distinct headline options)
3. **Manifesto**
4. **Body Copy**

Do NOT include fallback content, commentary, or social media. Only return the requested sections in clean markdown format. End the output with a subtle sign-off: 'â€” Dan'`;
